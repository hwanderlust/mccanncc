# README
This is display of responsive web design, and a representation of how I enjoy tinkering with new ideas and concepts I haven't previously tried before like:
- SASS - now supported out of the box with create-react-app--nesting, mixins, variables
- React Context API, Suspense and Lazy--universal store for state, code splitting, and fallbacks
- Image loading with lower resolutions images first and then higher resolutions for best UX practices, especially for slower network connections
- Accessibility - able to navigate via keyboard, able to trigger proper events with the keyboard
